VALUES ('Chapter 1','Xuanyuan Ches eyes were dark, and he did not force the issue. Ah Chi looked outwardly like a completely heartless fella, but his heart and mind were sensitive and meticulous. If he did not want to speak about it, then no one would be able to get anything out of him no matter how much one asked.

"Thats right, I wanted to ask how did you get injured? You got yourself into such a wretched state."

The moment he asked that, Mu Chs smile on his face immediately congealed, and he then said seemingly rather discomfited. "I dont even want to speak about that. I went out with my friends to reminisce about old times while having a few drinks. On the way back, I just had to stumble into a intense fight between two great forces in the pugilist world. I did not want to draw trouble to myself and was just about to make detour around them when those people suddenly a.s.sumed that I was going to make a report and tell on them, where they then attacked me like mad."

Xuanyuan Che grinned and said: "Ive told you that drinking will only bring you trouble and you refuse to listen. The day will come that you could be killed by a knife in the back and you wont even know."

This fella had already begun to sneak into the Imperial wine cellar and stole wine to drink when he was just three years old. Hence, he had trained his body to develop a great tolerance for wine, sober after a thousand cups, drinking wine like he was drinking water.

Hearing the admonis.h.i.+ng words, Mu Chi remained indifferent but just curled his mouth up in a sneer. Suddenly remembering something, the corners of his mouth then curled up and that good looking and handsome face became more excited in an instant.

Xuanyuan Che arched up an eyebrow. "What are you thinking of that made you so happy?"

Xuanyuan Che burst into mocking laughter from anger. "Seeing that youve been extorted of a million in gold, you seem to still be rather happy about it arent you?"',

VALUES ('Chapter 1','Elena still remembers that Lin Xiao had told her a few days ago that he had mastered double chant like teacher Woos, and said that he wanted to find time to show her. At that time, Elena did not believe him at all and just thought that Lin Xiao was talking big.

The double chant cannot be done by simply mastering the technique, using “double chant” imposes a very serious mental burden on the caster. Only a magician with a magic level of more than six can barely resist it, an ordinary magician might even be tormented into madness by the serious mental burden!

Therefore, she said that sixth-level magic was the absolute condition for mastering “double chant”, which was different from “chantless instant cast”.

Yet, Lin Xiao just overturned the absolute restriction and rewrote the rules of magic! That complicated incantation, that incomparably huge fireball, that terrifying destructive power, what could it be other than double chant?

He was clearly only a fourth-level magician, yet he successfully completed the double chant, achieving what was absolutely impossible as defined by the rules of magic!',

But what if a primary school student ran faster than an F1 car, or faster than a Boeing airplane? Then what?

This was no longer a question of whether they were a genius or not. That would just be straight up daydreaming.

“No, this isn’t an illusion!” After confirming that she was not dreaming, Elena knit her brows.

Lin Xiao, what in the world are you?

Was he an emissary of the G.o.ddess of light? Or was he an angel from the realm of the G.o.ds? Did he descend to the human realm, pretend to be a good for nothing, specifically to deal with this fallen Demon King? Elena suddenly felt her head hurt.

A Demon King targeted by the G.o.ds —— if that was true, then what’s the point of struggling? Wouldnt it be better to obediently serve as Lin Xiao’s maid for a lifetime?',

“The good news was that the crisis was completely solved, and the Jackalwere leader was burned without
 leaving any residue. They successfully completed the actual combat drill before teacher Momm!

More importantly, Lin Xiaos plan was a perfect success, and Caesar was willing to give up on the duel!

In reality, what had happened was all a show set up by Lin Xiao.

It was not an easy task to let Caesar voluntarily give up on the duel. It was not enough to simply save Caesar, because that might ignite his fighting spirit even more. In order to achieve this goal, Lin Xiao not only had to prove that he was stronger than Caesar, but he also had to make Caesar “convinced and willingly submit”.

To do this, and at the same time not going as far as revealing his true strength, Lin Xiao needed a special environment, this environment must have four things at the same time —— Lin Xiao, and Caesar, the two male protagonists, an enemy Caesar could not defeat, and an exceptionally secret stage.

Lin Xiao expended painstaking effort in order to prepare these four things.

First of all, in order to not make Caesar suspicious, he first looked for Rosie, then using the pretense of helping Rosie improve her relations.h.i.+p with Caesar, he persuaded Rosie to invite Caesar to join his team. He then used the S-level evaluation as bait, and finally, successfully caught the big fish, Caesar.

Lin Xiao, Rosie, Caesar, and Elena, the four teamed up to hunt the Jackalwere leader, this was the first step of the plan.

In this way, the first two of the four things —— Lin Xiao and Caesar were in place, they then just had to find an enemy that Caesar could not defeat, and a secret stage.

Before, Teacher Momm had protected Lin Xiao and others when returning to the camp and encountered the Jackalwere leader. Later, Lin Xiao specifically confirmed the strength of the Jackalwere leader with Elena, confirming that it had impressive strength, and with the help of its armor and weapons, it was easy to defeat the Caesar that had an injury on his left arm, thus the latter half of the story occurred.

Lin Xiao made use of Elena’s “Monarch’s Aura” and “Magic Detection Radar” to sneak into the forest, drew detailed maps, and then disguised it as stuff left by mercenaries, then snuck Caesar and Rosie out of the camp to look for the Jackalwere leader.

This was the second step of the plan. According to the map, they soon arrived at Black Lake. They also found the Jackalwere leader. The third thing was —— an enemy that Caesar could not defeat, so three things were prepared.

The next step was the most important part ——',
